# Update for the 3rd week of self reports

## 1.
- This week I mostly accomplished this weeks goals
- I successfully imported my two made files into their own dataframes
- I was able to join them based on their like words, and export that dataframe to a new excel sheet.
- I coded my scraper and my other program to remove stop words, which will get it ready for NLTk sentiment analysis.

## 2. 

- It takes a long time to run the programs

- I wasn't intending to remove stop words yet until I saw the merged data and realized some words showed up that really didn't need to.

- I'm considering taking data from other sources, but also realize that because of the timeconstraint it may be better to continue for now and improve on technique later


## 3. 

- I want to integrade sentiment analysis into my webscraping code   -2 days

- I want to look into using other sources for my data other than 4chan    -2 days

- I want to make progress on another part of my project, ie the next program that will graph data or maybe even the website    -3 days

## 4.
- I'm using beautiful soup and python pandas

- NLTK sentiment analysis along with other NLTK tools
