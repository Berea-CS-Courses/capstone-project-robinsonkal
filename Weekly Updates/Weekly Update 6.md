Update for the 6th week of self reports
1.
I finished adding context to messages
I polished up the graphing a bit
I've begun looking into using multiple resources for webscraping
2.
Becaused of the way I structured the code, it was rough getting the pre and post context for the messages

I don't have that much data the is well suited for graphing so the graphs might be a bit boring

Scraping multiple sites at once is hard because each site structures their html differently

3.
I need to perform testing -2 days

I want to institute NLTK sentiment analysis in some way, probably more towards the end of the program -1 days

I want to improve my corpus code, possibly by comparing scraped resources from multiple news sites. If I do this properly I should be able to scrape faster than from 4-chan because i'm cycling through multiple sites instead of just one. -3 days

4.
I'm using beautiful soup and python pandas

I'm using a python library called altair to chart and display data
