# Update for the 5th week of self reports

## 1.
- This week I switched focus to the comparison of the data via python and the website 
- I created a github.io webpage that will hold the table that I will create using the comparison file
- I recreated the analysis done in the excel comparison file into python
- Iv'e created a basic chart out of the data that isn't yet usable but will be used to display interesting data
- Iv'e found a resource called vega that might allow me to display a version of the charts that are interactable, which I might include, time dependant

## 2. 

- Becaused i focused on building things that will display my data, I didn't get much done in terms of data processing this week

- Because i've never formally wrote HTML i'm learning from internet resources, and learning a new skill takes time

- At first, the altair chart wasn't even showing up. Turns out in needs a form of java script to show properly but I was able to find a resource that allows me to see them in my IDE


## 3. 

- I want to put the data in the comparison program into a more formal format, and add context to the words in the dataframe.  -2 days

- I want to make some useful graphs from the data using altair    -1 days

- I want to improve my corpus code, possibly by comparing scraped resources from multiple news sites. If I do this properly I should be able to scrape faster than from 4-chan because i'm cycling through multiple sites instead of just one.    -3 days

## 4.
- I'm using beautiful soup and python pandas

- I'm using a python library called altair to chart and display data

- I used this tutorial: http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ to create my website. The CSS design comes from this tutorial
