# Update for the 2nd week of self reports

## 1.
- This week I accomplished this weeks goals
- I was able to successfully webscrape off of 4-chan and collected thousands of words
- I then cleaned that data a bit
- and finally I was able to get it uploaded to an excel doc for comaprison to the rueters corpus

## 2. 

- It takes a long time to run the program

- Because websites will kick a webscraper off if you send to many requests I had to work slow and carefully. Trial and error.

- Because I'm working with a messy source, it was a little harder to clean the data this time around. 


## 3. 

- I want to successfully import the two files back into a python dataframe for comparison   -1 day

- I want to successfully compare the two datasets to see what words are used more often then is usual    -2 days

- I want to either start looking into sentiment analysis or improve certain aspects of alrady designed systems    -3 days

## 4.
- I'm using beautiful soup and python pandas

- NLTK sentiment analysis along with other NLTK tools

- I'd add some pictures but it would look very similar to the last pictures. Its set up in the same way except I used 4chan text
