# Deliverable 0 - Project ideas

## Ideas

    
1. A sort of PSA website that fights against online hate groups by exposing their dogwhistles


    I've noticed that online individuals with racist sentiments often use coded language in order to not
    appear outwardly hostile towards other groups. For example, instead of using traditional hostile
    language, they might instead use an emoji to represent those same ideas. When someone calls them out
    on this, these individuals are able to deny their sentiments since it is just an emoji and surely they
    meant nothing by an ok sign emoji. This makes it difficult to differentiate between individuals who
    are legitimately racist or think they are just using internet slang.
    
    I have a few envisioned scenarios in which this might be helpful. One would be contructing a website
    which web scrapes certain messaging boards looking for trends in language usage and diaplays them on
    the website, therefore exposing the fact that that symbol might have ulterior meanings.
    
    Another way of representing this would be through a google chrome extension that automatically
    highlights any emoji or language that could potentially be being used in dangerous or irresponsible
    ways.

2. An app that Identifies plant species

    
    This would be useful for people who go on hikes, people who gather plants, and people who have a
    general interest in plant species.
    
    I think it would be cool to maybe make this into a game. Like pokemon go with plant species, and when
    you find a plant the location of it is marked down.
    
    The app would make it to where you can take a picture of the plant and then give you a
    percentage of how confident it is that its a certain type of plant.

3. A program that forces you to do homework

    
    This would be useful for students, such as myself, who oftentimes get distracted on my computer by
    things such as netflix or video games while trying to complete their homework. 
    
    The program would either forcibly open your homework, forcibly close attention getting non homework
    applications, or maybe create a pop-up when you spend too long on certain activities
    
    Maybe you could also integrate a chrome extension in which certain URLS get flagged and a timer begins
    which eventually closes those tabs.

## Preffered Idea

I prefer to do the anti online racism project(#1). I prefer to do this project because it is a huge

problem on the internet and an application such as this could actually shed a light on it. I have concerns

about having to access these chat forums and the mental annoyance it will be to read these peoples

thoughts, but I do think that a successful project like this really could improve the wellbeing of most

internet users. I think my base goal will be to set up a website that has a scrolling of the top 50

dogwhistles or sayings that are used on these sites. A chrome extension might be cool, and would access

the same database that the website would access, but I might not have the time to accomplish this. My

largest concern is time. It seems like a somewhat big project and there are certain things that I don't

know how to do or would need a refresher on. I guess the bare bones basic version of this project would be

a program and not to necessarily have that program embedded into a website.
