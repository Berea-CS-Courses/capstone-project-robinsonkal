Text Corpus Comparison Example

## Concept Documentation
1. Just python and the Natural Language Tool Kit Library, along with some NLTK downloads.
2. Since i'm thinking the proof of concept will just be a python program,
all that will need to be done is to run said program. I'll have some fake data so no need for inputs.
3. Right now the proof of conecpt consists of some text analysis and text corpus comparison that can identify rare words. For example, the term "skittles" is a dogwhistle and said word does not appear in the corpus text's and thus it is identified
4. I learned to play with the text corpora through this website, some of the code is similar. https://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html

I followed this tutorial to find out how to set up the sentiment analysis. As such, basically all of it comes form this resource https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-perform-sentiment-analysis-in-python-3-using-the-natural-language-toolkit-nltk

I followed this tutorial for my webscraper: https://matix.io/extract-text-from-webpage-using-beautifulsoup-and-python/

## Updates

Reworked most of the D2 document to be up to specs with the outline given in D3. Specified

details about the webscraper application, added information about the graphical representation program

specified means of storage, it JSON vs Text file vs Database. 




## Reflection

I'm a bit more confident in the project since I was kind of able to identify some of my artificial dogwhistles using pretty basic techniques.

The hardest part so far was learning how to use the text corpus, so learning many new things very quickly has been most challenging

I don't think I need anything from instructors yet, but when I get deeper into the project I might in the future.
