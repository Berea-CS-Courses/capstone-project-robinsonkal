## Running project name: Digital Dogwhistle Deducer

## Project Overview

My project is generally about exposing dogwhistles on white supremecist/racist/Nazi messaging boards.

This will be done by webscraping these messaging boards and looking for trends using text analysis. The

ultimate goal of the project is to successfully identify coded racist language online, creating a list of

current coded language that racists are using to communicate hateful language. I will then turn this

application into a sort of website PSA on how people use dogwhistles online, and how to avoid them/

identify users. These identified word will update every few weeks as the nature of dogwhistles is

that they change on a regular basis in order to avoid detection.

## Concept

The heart of this project is a program that can webscrape sites and look for keywords that may represent

racist dogwhistle language. If this is not accomplished, I would still have an application that gathers

trends in language on these sites, which isn't worthless, but also is not the original meaning of the

project. I hope to insert this application into a PSA website that describes the issue, as well as

displays the type of language that is currently being used to describe hateful language. On this website,

i'd like to represent this information in a graphical sense, and maybe give some context to some o the

language being used. I don't want this project to be accusitory in nature as some people use similar

language online without even realizing that behind those words are. So anything accusing specific people

of being this or that is outside of the scope of this project and morally questionable. The idea of a

chrome extension that identifies certain problematic words in posts or website on the go is interesting to
me, and

I may look into this if I am able to accomplish my other goals first, but it is probably outside

of the scope of this project.

## Requirements

### Functional

* Has to scrape data from a website (Testing to establish what sites, but a few come to mind)
* Has to process data (Testing required on methodoligies)
* Has to put data into a file
* file(s) need to be somewhat organized
* Has to show data in a way that is useful, maybe in a graphical context
* Has to refresh data every few weeks to establish new vocabulary

### Non-Functional

* User has to have a computer, internet connection
* User has to have the link to the website/access to program
* Software should be transferrable to web application
